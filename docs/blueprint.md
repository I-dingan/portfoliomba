## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) for a professional yet creative feel.
- Background color: Very Light Gray (#F0F0F0), nearly white, for a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), chosen because it provides good contrast against indigo, drawing attention to calls to action.
- Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern look.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, as a bolder statement that complements 'Inter'.
- Use a consistent set of modern, line-style icons to represent different sections and skills.
- Implement a clean, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Use a grid system for consistent alignment.
- Subtle, smooth transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.  For example, use fade-in effects for content loading and hover effects on interactive elements.
